### Instructions for getting started with Python
1. Macs come with Python out of the box, but to confirm you have it, open a terminal window and run the command `python --version`,
2. If you have Python installed, great! If not, download the latest version here --> https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. If you do not have xCode, enter `xcode-select --install` in your terminal.
