# ZippysMagicalFunTime
Welcome to the repo for our TDD meetup! This repo contains katas that we will practice. Guests can choose whatever language they would like to work in but included is a guide to set up a java enviornment. We will also have a USB drive that will have the files needed for an install on mac and windows but highly encourage people to come already prepared. The USB Drive will also have a clone of this repo on it incase internet access is an issue.

### Instructions for getting started with Java
1. Pull up a terminal and run the command `java -version` to see if you have Java installed.
  - if running on windows, do yourself a favor and install git bash --> https://gitforwindows.org/ then run the above command
2. If you have Java installed, great! If not intall a JDK here --> https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html
3. Once your JDK is installed, Go ahead and install intelliJ --> https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
4. Now you should have your JDK and IDE setup! Now just choose one of the katas you would like to do and clone them onto your system. 

### Idea for meetup structure
1. When people arrive they must sign in. We will set them up in pairs. 
2. First we will explain TDD in a nut shell, then show an example of a first test or two and how it works in a pair (via pingpong method etc.)
3. I think that each and every meeting should start with FizzBuzz to get juices flowing and be an introduction to new comers.
4. We will announce pairs. 
5. Pairs do FizzBuzz
6. Announce the kata we will be practicing.
- There is a catalog of katas in the to start that I cloned from elsewhere. I suggest we pick one for each week. If some people finish faster than others we can add on additional criteria such as an interface for example.
7. Open up for sharing solutions at the end
