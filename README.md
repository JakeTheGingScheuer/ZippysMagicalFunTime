# ZippysMagicalFunTime
Welcome to the repo for our TDD meetup! This repo contains katas that we will practice. Guests can choose whatever language they would like to work in but included is a guide to set up a java enviornment. We will also have a USB drive that will have the files needed for an install on mac and windows but highly encourage people to come already prepared. The USB Drive will also have a clone of this repo on it incase internet access is an issue.

### Instructions for getting started with Java
1. Pull up a terminal and run the command `java -version` to see if you have Java installed.
  - if running on windows, do yourself a favor and install git bash --> https://gitforwindows.org/ then run the above command
2. If you have Java installed, great! If not intall a JDK here --> https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html
3. Once your JDK is installed, Go ahead and install intelliJ --> https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
4. Now you should have your JDK and IDE setup! Now just choose one of the katas you would like to do and clone them onto your system.
