    Pull up a terminal and run the command java -version to see if you have Java installed.

    if running on windows, do yourself a favor and install git bash --> https://gitforwindows.org/ then run the above command

    If you have Java installed, great! If not install a JDK here --> https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html
    Once your JDK is installed, Go ahead and install intelliJ --> https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
    Now you should have your JDK and IDE setup! Now just choose one of the katas you would like to do and clone them onto your system.
